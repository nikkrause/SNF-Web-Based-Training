	<h1>Job Aid A &ndash; Common SNF Documentation Errors</h1>

  <section>
  	<h2>Common Errors</h2>
    
    <p>Medicare pays for certain skilled services provided in various skilled nursing settings, including swing-bed hospitals, nursing homes, and other freestanding facilities; only if the certification and recertification of services meet certain content criteria.</p>
    
    <p>A major source of improper payments stems from skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) failure to obtain certification and recertification statements from physicians or non-physician practitioners (NPPs). Common errors identified in documenting SNF services include:</p>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>Missing or undated physician signature on order, plan of care, or certification statement</li>
    	<li>Missing progress notes or notes that do not fully justify the medical necessity of services</li>
    	<li>Failure to document the patient needs daily skilled care in a SNF after the required 3-day hospital stay for the condition being treated and how long such care is needed</li>
    	<li>Failure to document that continued care is necessary beyond the initial certification period, especially for another condition that arose during treatment for the original diagnosis that also requires a SNF level of care</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
  	<h2>Certification Requirements</h2>
    
		<p>The certification/recertification statements may be entered on forms, notes, records, or separate form that the appropriate individual signs. You do not need to duplicate records if the required certification/recertification criteria is contained in other provider records, such as physicians’ progress notes. However, the certification/recertification statement must indicate where the information is located. For more information on certification or recertification for SNF care, refer to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/ge101c04.pdf" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, Chapter 4, Section 40</a>.</p>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>Certification Statements</h3>
    	
    	<p>The certification statement must clearly document:</p>
    	
    	<ol>
    		<li>The patient needs skilled nursing care (furnished directly by or requiring the supervision of skilled nursing personnel) or other skilled rehabilitation services</li>
    		<li>Such services are required daily</li>
    		<li>Such services can only practically be provided in a SNF or swing-bed hospital on an inpatient basis</li>
    		<li>Such services are for an ongoing condition for which the patient received inpatient care in a hospital</li>
    		<li>A dated signature of the certifying physician or NPP</li>
    	</ol>
    </div>

    <div>
    	<h3>Recertification Statements</h3>
    	
    	<p>The recertification statement must clearly document:</p>
    	
    	<ol>
    		<li>The reasons for the continued need for post hospital SNF care</li>
    		<li>The estimated time the patient will need to remain in the SNF</li>
    		<li>Plans for home care, if any</li>
    		<li>Specify if the reason for continued need for services is a condition that arose after admission to the SNF and while the patient was still under treatment for the condition for which the individual received inpatient care in a hospital </li>
    		<li>A dated signature of the recertifying physician or NPP</li>
    	</ol>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
  	<h2>Timing of Certification and Recertification Statements</h2>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>The certification must be <span class="bold">obtained at the time of admission</span> or as soon thereafter as is reasonable and practicable.</li>
			<li>The first recertification statement is required no later than the <span class="bold">14th day</span> of post hospital SNF care.</li>
			<li>Subsequent recertification statements are required at least every <span class="bold">30 days</span> after the first recertification.</li>
    </ul>	

    <div>
    	<h3>Delayed or Late Certification and Recertification Statements</h3>
    	
    	<p>SNFs are expected to obtain timely certification/recertification statements. However, delayed certifications/recertifications will be honored where, for example, there has been an isolated oversight or lapse. In addition to complying with the content requirements, delayed certification/recertification statements must include an explanation for the delay and any medical or other evidence that the SNF considers relevant for purposes of explaining the delay.</p>

  	<h2>Example of Improper Payment for a Missing Recertification Element</h2>
  	
  	<p>A SNF submitted a claim for skilled services provided to a beneficiary. The SNF submitted the following documentation:</p>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>Signed recertification form missing the estimated length of stay</li>
    	<li>Physician’s orders</li>
    	<li>Physician’s progress note</li>
    	<li>Physical and occupational therapy evaluations and plans of care along with daily treatment notes</li>
    	<li>Acute inpatient hospital records</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The submitted documentation was missing a valid recertification. The SNF used a separate form for the recertification statement. While the form had an area for the certifying provider to document the estimated length of stay, this was left blank and there was no indication of where this information could be located (for example, medical record). This claim was not paid due to insufficient documentation.</p>
