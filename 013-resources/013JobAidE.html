	<h1>Job Aid E &ndash; Frequently Asked Questions about SNF Consolidated Billing</h1>
	
	<section>
  	<h2>Are outpatient observation charges for a SNF’s Part A resident included in SNF consolidated billing?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes. Major Category I.G lists “emergency services” as one of the high-intensity outpatient hospital services that are excluded from consolidated billing. However, outpatient observation services are a distinct service category that utilizes a different revenue code (762) than emergency room services (45x) and, thus, would not be considered excluded “emergency services” under Major Category I.G. Accordingly, outpatient observation services would remain subject to consolidated billing when furnished to a SNF’s Part A resident.</p>
  </section>

	<section>
  	<h2>If a patient is on custodial care in a SNF, can a therapy department bill for services?</h2>
    
    <p>No. If a patient resides in a Medicare certified part of the facility, the SNF is responsible for all therapy services provided.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  	<h2>Are Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) subject to SNF consolidated billing guidelines?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes. Services provided at an ASC or non-hospital facility are included in consolidated billing. Providers look to the SNF for payment.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  	<h2>Is there a timely filing deadline when billing a SNF?</h2>
    
    <p>Billing must occur within one year from the date of service. You must also file claims in chronological order for each beneficiary to accurately track benefit utilization days.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  	<h2>How do providers file a complaint against a SNF that does not pay them?</h2>
    
		<p><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/Review-Contractor-Directory-Interactive-Map" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Contact your MAC</a> with at least three documented attempts of reaching the SNF for payment to address payment issues.</p>
    
    <p>Contact CMS regarding the noncompliant facility.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  	<h2>Can providers bill Part B for Evaluation &amp; Management (E&amp;M) or debridement codes?</h2>
    
		<p>Yes. Most E&amp;M services and debridement are excluded from SNF consolidated billing. Providers must check the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Billing/SNFConsolidatedBilling/2017-Part-B-MAC-Update.html" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Part B File 1</a> for the specific codes in question to determine liability.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  	<h2>Does Medicare issue a letter indicating a patient’s benefits are exhausted?</h2>
    
    <p>Medicare does not issue benefit exhaust letters. This information will appear on your remittance advice statement and the beneficiary’s Medicare Summary Notice (MSN).</p>
  </section>  
  
  <section>
  	<h2>Can an inpatient hospital stay in a Veteran's Administration (VA) hospital be used to meet the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) three-day qualifying stay in an inpatient hospital requirement?</h2>
    
    <p>If the VA hospital is enrolled in Medicare and/or meets the criteria for being an emergency hospital, then the VA inpatient hospital stay can be used to meet the Medicare three-day qualifying inpatient hospital stay requirement.</p>
    
		<p>As per the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c08.pdf#page=8" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Medicare Benefits Policy Manual, Chapter 8, Section 20.1</a>: “The hospital must be either a Medicare-participating hospital or an institution that meets at least the conditions of participation for an emergency hospital.”</p>
  </section>  
  
  <section>
  	<h2>What ambulance transport services can I bill under consolidated billing?</h2>
    
		<p>For a list of ambulance services excluded from and included in consolidated billing, refer to MLN Matters&reg; article <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/se0433.pdf" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Skilled Nursing Facility Consolidated Billing As It Relates to Ambulance Services</a>.</p>
