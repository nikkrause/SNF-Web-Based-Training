	<h1>Job Aid D &ndash; SNF Consolidated Billing Parts A and B Code Files</h1>
	
	<p>Services not included in the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System (PPS) and Part A Consolidated Billing (CB) requirements are called “excluded” services. For SNF CB, “excluded” means these services are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B rather than bundled into the SNF’s comprehensive PPS per diem payment for the covered Part A stay. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) regularly updates code lists (files) with these services.</p>
	
  <section>
  	<h2>Part A (Institutional) or Part B (Professional) Exclusions</h2>
    
    <p>SNF CB-excluded services are identified as institutional (bill to Medicare Part A) or professional (bill to Medicare Part B). <abbr title="Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services">CMS</abbr> annually updates SNF CB files to identify the specifically included and excluded services by billing codes.</p>

  	<h2>Part A Files: Major Categories</h2>
    
		<p>The annual SNF Part A update file contains a comprehensive list of codes excluded (sometimes included) from Part A SNF CB organized by major category. The five major categories are described below. The <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Billing/SNFConsolidatedBilling/Downloads/14MajorCatExpl.pdf" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">General Explanation of the Major Categories for SNF CB</a> fact sheet includes a synopsis of the Part A Major Category files. </p>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>Major Category I: Excluded Services Beyond the Scope of a SNF</h3>
    	
    	<p>Certain outpatient services are excluded from SNF CB only when provided in a hospital or Critical Access Hospital (CAH). Major Category I breaks down into the following subcategories:</p>
    	
    	<ol class="alpha">
    		<li>Computerized axial tomography (CT) scans</li>
    		<li>Cardiac catheterization</li>
    		<li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
    		<li>Radiation therapy</li>
    		<li>Angiography, lymphatic, venous, and related procedures</li>
    		<li>Outpatient surgery and related procedures (lists inclusions rather than exclusions)</li>
    		<li>Emergency services</li>
    		<li>Ambulance transportation for the above listed services and Category II. A.</li>
    		<li>Additional excluded surgery codes</li>
    	</ol>
    </div>

    <div>
    	<h3>Major Category II: Excluded Services when Rendered to Specific Beneficiaries</h3>
    	
    	<p>Major Category II includes End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and hospice services provided to beneficiaries with ESRD or beneficiaries who elected hospice. Major Category II breaks down into the following subcategories:</p>
    	
    	<ol class="alpha">
    		<li>Dialysis, Erythropoietin (EPO), Aranesp®, and other dialysis-related services for ESRD beneficiaries are excluded from SNF CB for:
    			<ul>
    				<li>Services provided in a Renal Dialysis Facility (RDF), including medically necessary ambulance services to and from the RDF</li>
    				<li>Home dialysis services when the SNF constitutes the beneficiary’s home</li>
    				<li>EPO or Aranesp used along with dialysis and given by the RDF</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>
    		<li>Hospice services for terminal conditions of beneficiaries who elect hospice are excluded from CB. Hospice services for terminal conditions are identified with Types of Bill (TOBs) 81X or 82X. For beneficiaries who elect hospice, SNF PPS and CB include services that are unrelated to the beneficiary’s terminal condition.</li>
    	</ol>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>Major Category III: Excluded Services Rendered by Certified Providers</h3>
    	
    	<p>Major Category III includes services that are excluded only if rendered by any Medicare provider other than a SNF. Major Category III breaks down into the following subcategories:</p>
    
			<ol class="alpha">
				<li>Certain chemotherapy drugs</li>
				<li>Chemotherapy administration</li>
				<li>Radioisotopes and their administration</li>
				<li>Customized prosthetic devices</li>
			</ol>

			<p>If a SNF provides the listed services, they are included in the SNF PPS and CB.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>Major Category IV: Excluded Preventive and Screening Services</h3>
    	
    	<p>Preventive and screening services are excluded from the Part A payment made under the SNF PPS but are subject to SNF CB. As such, they are separately payable under Medicare Part B, but only to the SNF. The SNF must bill the following services for beneficiaries in a covered Part A stay with Part B eligibility on TOB 22X:</p>
    
			<ol class="alpha">
				<li>Mammography</li>
				<li>Vaccines (pneumococcal, seasonal influenza, or hepatitis B)</li>

    </div>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>Major Category V: Included Part B Therapy Services in SNF CB</h3>
    	
    	<p>Therapy services are included in SNF PPS and CB for residents in a covered Part A stay. The SNF also must bill these services for its “Part B” residents (those residents who are in noncovered Part B stays). Physical Therapy (PT), Occupational Therapy (OT), and/or Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) services, whether furnished by (or under the supervision of) a physician or other health care professional, are included in the SNF PPS and CB requirements.</p>
    </div>

  <section>
  	<h2>Part B Files</h2>
  	
		<p>The Part B files includes a comprehensive list of codes organized by services provided in a Part A covered SNF stay (Files 1-3) and Part B noncovered stay (File 4). When you click the “Part B MAC Update” for a specific year from the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Billing/SNFConsolidatedBilling/FileExplanation.html" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) File Explanation webpage</a>, you will see an explanation of each file and the links to the four Zip files: Part A Physician, Part A Professional, Part A Ambulance, and Part B Therapy. Refer to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Billing/SNFConsolidatedBilling/Downloads/adobe_inst.pdf" class="inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="-1">Search Instructions</a> to navigate the files. Check for periodic updates throughout the year.</p>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>File 1 - Part A Stay - Physician Services</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>File 2 - Part A Stay - Professional Components of Services to be Submitted with a -26 Modifier</h3>
    	
    	<p>Files 1 and 2 include codes that can be separately billed to the Part B MAC by physicians, non-physician practitioners (NPPs), and suppliers (other than ambulance suppliers). If the code is not found in either of these two files, the service is subject to SNF consolidated billing and the physician, NPP, or supplier must look to the SNF for payment of the service. The MAC will not pay the service.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>File 3 - Part A Stay - Ambulance</h3>
    	
    	<p>File 3 is just for ambulance services. The codes in this file, when submitted with the NN origin/destination modifier, (that is, transport between two SNFs), are subject to consolidated billing and the supplier must look to the SNF for payment of the service. The Part B MAC will not pay the service. The services are separately payable by the MAC when submitted with any other origin/destination modifier.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    	<h3>File 4 - Part B Stay Only - Therapy Services</h3>
    	
    	<p>Use File 4 only for services rendered to beneficiaries in Part B noncovered stays. It includes the therapy codes that are subject to SNF consolidated billing for beneficiaries in Part B noncovered SNF stays. The physician, NPP, or supplier must look to the SNF for payment of these services. The Part B MAC will not pay these services.</p>
